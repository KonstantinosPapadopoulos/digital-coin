# DigitalCoin

In the project DigitalCoin, the central authority receives transactions from users. It creates and processes transactions and produces the ledger. It organizes transactions into time periods or blocks. In each block, the central authority will receive a list of transactions, validate the transactions it receives, and publish a list of validated transactions.
